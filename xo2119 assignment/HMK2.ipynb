    "In 1990, Mr. A decided to invest in a Mexican food cart in Manhattan. He would work 5 days a week from 11:30 AM to 1:30 PM. His focus was to sell the best burritos in town. In the neighborhood, he remained the only burrito cart owner for 4 years, until 1995, when a competitor, Mr. B, decided to open up another burrito cart in the neighborhood. Mr. B was able to build a name very fast. People liked his burritos much more and with time, he became people's #1 choice. In 2000, two new burrito carts opened and 5 years later the fifth one opened. These last carts used to sell their burritos for much less but were never able to offer burritos that were as tasty as those offered by Mr. B. By then, Mr. A was unable to compete anymore; he neither had a price nor quality advantage and decided to shut down his business in 2008. To see each cart's market share from 1990 - 2010, load the following file into a table: `marketshare.csv`"
